## Specialty Interest Series Overview
  
> The Specialty Interest Series is a biweekly career lunch seminar series that brings a diverse group of clinicians from affiliated hospitals to HMS to discuss different specialty areas. All main specialties (over 19 altogether) are represented.

Since I'm quite undecided about which area I want to specialize in, I thought it'd be great to hear more about all the different available areas from people who actually work in them now. The following is a sorted collection of paraphrased quotes that I thought were interesting or useful. 

## tl;dr

- **General work**
    - Largely diagnostic and care management work. 
    - Subspecializations include stroke, epilepsy, and neuro-oncology
- **Patient interaction**
    - Chronic illness and longitudinal treatment means long-term relationships
    - Ability to help manage diseases that profoundly change the way patients interact with the world
- **Lifestyle**
    - Hours: around 8:30am to 6:00pm
    - Variable workload: ranges from Netflix/Youtube to constant admissions and patient visits
    - Good flexibility: can maintain a regular schedule of 1 week on, 1 week off, or down to 1 outpatient day/week

## HMS Match

> Based on 24 applicants in neurology and child neurology from the 2015-2018 match lists

- Mid-low number of applicants: average 6 per year (range: 5-7)
- High internal match rate: 79% of HMS students who successfully matched into neurology or child neurology went to BCH/MGH

Good neurologists are intellectually curious about the nervous system. The old adage about neurology is that all neurologists are expert diagnosticians who can't actually do anything for their patients. This is untrue; clinical advancements allow us to make a big difference in managing and treating disease. 

My schedule as a resident on the stroke service was as follows: I would arrive at 6am and start rounding from 7am-10:30am, with intermittent lectures. There's usually a group lecture at noon with free lunch. The afternoon is then work rounds (following up on diagnostics, discharging patients, etc.) until around 5pm, when the chief resident wraps things up and you go home. On important days, junior residents stay longer. 

The stroke service was very imaging-heavy, involving reads of many CT scans. The rest of my work largely involved conditions like headaches, fainting, and tremors. Nowadays, my work in neurocritical care follows a flexible 1 week on, 1-2 weeks off schedule.

> Third-year Resident at MGH; Pre-Fellow in Neuro-Oncology

I was attracted to neurology because there's no other field where disease has so profoundly changed the way the patient interacts with and perceives the world. A lot of the work involves helping patients overcome disability. 

People say neurology is depressing because patients don’t get better, but this is not true. The brain can recover, and our patients often look very different just a few months later. 

On a day-to-day level, neurology residency involves many night shifts. Busy days mean a lot of clinical decisions; lax days mean a lot of Netflix and Youtube. My current workday goes from 7pm to 8am. When other team members arrive in the morning, I present a morning report and review new overnight admissions. 


### Bernard Chang

> Associate Professor of Neurology at BIDMC, Advisory Dean of Peabody Society at HMS

I enjoy neurology because of the long-term relationships with patients; there are many chronic illness that are managed but not cured. 

I want to point out that the experiences of this panel might not be entirely representative. The residents you've just heard from typically handle the sickest inpatients, but most patients are less critical outpatients (over 90% come from the ER). Similarly over 80% of neurologists are in private practice, and none of us can offer a perspective outside academia. 

That being said, I can tell you more about life as an attending. My schedule involves two half-days of outpatient clinical work a week. Every year, I will also spend ten weeks in the inpatient service (typically in two week blocks). My hours are 8:30am-6:30pm, but I'll sometimes go in as early as 6am to get work done before everyone else arrives. As for my non-clinical work days, I spend around 50% of time advising and teaching medical students and residents, and serving on administrative committees. The rest of the time, I serve as an editor for a neurology journal and review manuscripts for publication.
