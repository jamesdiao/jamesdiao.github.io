### tl;dr 


#### The current state of medical education
In the past decade, medicine has increasingly turned to evidence-based standards for diagnosis. For example: the Rome criteria used to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome, or certain genetic variants used to diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. When based on well-understood mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, this is, of course, a very good thing. However, not all diagnoses are as straightforward. As it stands, non-EBM (evidence-based medicine) diagnoses generally rest on two pillars: inferences from mechanistic understandings, and observed clinical associations. The latter, also commonly referred to as "clinical pearls," are generally qualitative claims with little or no evidence. However, they are often all that physicians have to rely on. 

#### "Classic presentation," "Consistent with", and other code words for stereotyping
Common in medical education is the endorsement of stereotyping, or the use of a standard mental picture "conforming to a fixed or general pattern". Such patterns can be a very useful tool for summarizing associations, and I don't mean to say that stereotyping is always a bad thing. However, the oversimplifications involved may cause problems, especially when they mask what is unknown. 

POST: statistics in medicine
- [ ] Principles: p values, Bayesian reasoning and priors, multiple hypothesis testing, effect sizes, systematic error and overconfidence curves
- [ ] Teach relative frequency (not rare enough; "classic presentation" frequency)
- [ ] Balancing probability with cost of error 
- [ ] Hoofbeats think horses
