### tl;dr 
Anki is a flashcard app that is startlingly effective for memorizing vast amounts of information. 

### Overview
Just as a quick intro: Anki is a flashcard app, much like Quizlet. You learn by testing yourself on flashcards; you can either make them yourself or download shared decks from online. The core premise of Anki is the spaced repetition system, which schedules the next time you see a card based on how well you know the material. The interval increases every time you get it right (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, etc.) by about 2.5x, but the interval resets if you get it wrong. 

#### Advantages
Anyone who's talked with me in 2019 has heard me sing Anki's praises. I was introduced to it second semester of M1 year, and it has fundamentally transformed the way I learn for medical school. There are a couple big benefits of Anki over regular studying (several are discussed in [Anki's manual](https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html)).
1. **Active recall**: people remember things much better when they're tested on it rather than passively absorbing it. 
2. **Spaced repetition**: spreading out reviews over time is very effective for long-term retention. 
3. **Ease of use**: reviews can be done easily on a phone, making it possible to be productive during "dead time," like sitting in traffic, or if you can't fall asleep. 
4. **Gameification**: being able to track all your statistics (e.g., cards per day, hours per day, proportion of cards matured, proportion of cards remaining, etc.) gives me a sense of progress and makes studying more fun.  

#### Disadvantages
1. **Scope**: Anki is primary useful for a small subset of learning: memorizing details where it is important to know them [1] quickly and [2] without looking it up. 
2. **Startup cost**: it takes a while to get used to the process of suspending and editing cards. 
3. **Making cards**: shared decks don't always overlap perfectly with class, and it takes some effort to make cards for the non-overlapping areas. 

### What does it look like? 
I currently use Zanki: the most popular Step 1 deck for medical students. There's a deck for each other major subjects (cardiology, endocrine, etc.), as shown below:

### Other Uses
Anki works well for tasks outside of medical school too. Another task Anki is great for is facial recognition. I have nearly 200 classmates I see around at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Dental Medicine, and it's not easy to remember everyone's name. I also have around 50 colleagues at PathAI, and I like the idea of having everyone's name down. 

As a result, I made a deck for both of these groups, which took longer than I expected (around 40-50 minutes). They look something like this: 

<img src="/img/anki-james-face-1.png" alt="Anki Face 1" title="Anki Face 1" style="width:300px;height:364px;">
<img src="/img/anki-james-face-2.png" alt="Anki Face 2" title="Anki Face 2" style="width:300px;height:364px;">

Some problems: one picture is not a lot to learn off of, and sometimes I overfit to details of that particular picture (hair length, glasses, etc.) But in general, I'm now able to picture the names of most of my classmates I see around the HMS atrium, which is pretty cool! 


### Conclusion
Anki has made a big difference for my medical training. I'm more productive during the day, and I retain more of what I'm learning. Just to show the depth of my obsession: there was one week where I averaged almost 2.5 hours a day on Anki, significantly more than all of my other apps combined.

I've only been using Anki for about a month, so we'll see whether I can keep it up. Still, I'm completely sold on the idea and I'm optimistic it will continue to work out.
