## Specialty Interest Series Overview
  
> The Specialty Interest Series is a biweekly career lunch seminar series that brings a diverse group of clinicians from affiliated hospitals to HMS to discuss different specialty areas. All main specialties (over 19 altogether) are represented.

Since I'm quite undecided about which area I want to specialize in, I thought it'd be great to hear more about all the different available areas from people who actually work in them now. The following is a sorted collection of paraphrased quotes that I thought were interesting or useful. 

## tl;dr

- **General work**
    - Contouring organs and planning radiation treatments
    - Discussing treatment plans with patients and medical/surgical oncologists
- **Patient interaction**
    - Many conversations on high-stakes and end-of-life issues 
    - 30-40% of care is for advanced and incurable patients--largely palliative therapies
- **Lifestyle-friendly**
    - Hours: around 8:30am to 5:00pm
    - Almost every clinician present talked about how they appreciated the flexibility, predictability, and balance of the field
- **Well-compensated**
    - D'Amico: radiation oncologists are paid "a surgeon's salary"
    - In Boston, this amounts to around \$300,000 per year + \$50,000 bonus
    - By comparison, most internal medicine subspecialists are paid around $100,000 less
- **Small field**
    - D'Amico: each year, there may only be fewer than 6 job openings in all of Boston
- **Highly technical**
    - 3 full years of cancer clinical training, compared to 1 year in medical oncology
    - Residents are required to learn every major trials in oncology; not just in radiation, but also surgical and drug-based
    - Exciting new diagnostic and therapeutic technologies; tumor heterogeneity makes oncology relatively future-proof

## HMS Match

> Based on 32 applicants from the 2015-2018 match lists

- Mid-low number of applicants: average 8 per year (range: 4-11)
- High internal match rate: 50% of HMS students who successfully matched into radiation oncology went to BWH/DFCC/MGH (range: 38-75%)
- High interest from HST (7/8 applicants were from HST in 2016)

Every specialty has its own personality. When the orthopedic surgeons come in, you'll see: they're very different from the dermatologists. It has do with your values. So who should go into radonc? 

First and foremost, you need to be someone who derives fulfillment from being in front of someone who’s been diagnosed with cancer. They are scared to death. Their family is scared. A radiation oncologist will, through education, patience, and kindness, clearly and methodically give them the knowledge they need to get to the next step of what they can do. Radiation oncology is very personal. There will be long face-to-face conversations and family meetings. They will hang on every word you say. They will not forget anything. They are looking to you for hope. If you thrive on these situations, radonc may be for you. 

Second, you need technical proficiency. Radonc is the surgical equivalent of local treatment. You have to be able to understand and plan radiation treatment based on complex 3D images from multiple sources (CT, PET, etc.).

The job has immense variety, and all the residents and attendings are happy. I get to see my kids as much as I need. That's not to say I don't work hard--if you add in research, I work just as many hours as any other specialty. But I have more of a say in how I organize my day. If all else is equal, I'd advise that you go for the job that offers balance and predictability. 

### Fallon Chipidza

> Fellow, Harvard Radiation Oncology Program

In my third year, I was mostly undifferentated, but was interested in both medical oncology and radiation oncology. I liked that radiation oncology was very team-dependent and got a lot of patient interaction. I also liked the technical aspects--contouring and physics are very cool. 

There's also a misconception that radonc is a "lifestyle specialty" where you don't have to work very hard. That's not true--there are days when I've been in the office until 9pm. It is not chill. 

### Jennifer Wo

> Clinical Attending at MGH and Assistant Professor at HMS

If you love dealing with patients and critical moments, you should consider radiation oncology. You see most of your patients alongside surgeons and medoncs, and you hear all the surgical and chemo questions and learn all the differences and subtleties. 

The lifestyle also allows work-life balance. I knew I wanted a family. I was married and thinking of children, and found the chance to pursue this. I ended up having 3 kids in 6 years; my patients would come back in and ask "are you pregnant again??"

The hours go from around 8:00-9:00 to 4:30-5:30. Most of time is clinical, with academic work sandwiched into my free time. Taking 1-2 months off at a time is tough because oncology comes with longitudinal relationships and continuity of care. Sabbaticals are possible, but must be planned in advance. This model would be easier with shift work, like in emergency medicine.
