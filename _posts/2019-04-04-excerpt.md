### tl;dr 
The first computational research project I worked on in [Gerstein Lab](/research/gerstein-lab) (debugging and quality control analysis for an exRNA-Seq analysis pipeline) was finally published, nearly 4 years after I started working on it.

### Non-technical summary

Our bodily fluids (e.g., blood, urine, etc.) contain many different molecules that can be used to diagnose and track disease. Most non-invasive diagnostic tests--from pregnancy tests to cancer biomarkers--look for abnormal levels of specific proteins. More recently, scientists have discovered that another type of molecule, exRNA, can also be measured from fluid samples for diagnostic purposes. To help standardize the study of exRNA, the NIH put together a consortium--the Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium (ERCC). 

The analysis of exRNA presents a number of technical problems. For example: there's not that much of it floating around in most bodily fluids, and sequencing samples are often vulnerable to contamination and artifacts. To address these challenges, our lab developed a pipeline called **exceRpt**: **ex**tra-**ce**llular **R**NA **p**rocessing **t**oolkit. exceRpt consists of a series of filtering steps (to remove contamination and artifacts) and alignment steps (to match observed molecular sequences with known sequences). It accepts raw sequence reads as inputs and returns abundance estimates and quality control reports (I contributed to this part!) as outputs. 

The hope is that everyone can process their sequencing data using the same pipeline, so that their outputs are all comparable and fully reproducible. So far, exceRpt has been used to process thousands of exRNA-seq datasets in the public exRNA Atlas (our [paper](/research/exrna-atlas) on this came out today too!) and is freely available at [http://genboree.org/site/exrna_toolset](https://genboree.org/site/exrna_toolset/) and [github.gersteinlab.org/exceRpt](https://github.gersteinlab.org/exceRpt).
