POST: FAQ: degrees, options, role models (?), 

AI
Optimal stopping: degrees
Explore-exploit: different summers, different environs, jobs
Pointiness, beam search, hill-climbing: how well > what, badge collection and perception
Define your utility function: papers, revenue, FIRE
Constrained optimization: ethics, family, etc. 
Multidisciplinary fields: Joint probabilities are smaller than marginals 
Patience vs greed


Bio
The importance of stroma
Be a k-strategist
catepillars, ducklings, and tadpoles
Everyone is different
Uncertainty reigns
Jobs are jobs; every one has bitch work

Psych and biases:
Buzzwords and titles over tasks 
Hard skills over soft skills and reputation 
The grass is greener effect 
Most good jobs are hidden

Pick what you don't hate
People would care less about what others think of them if they knew how little they did
