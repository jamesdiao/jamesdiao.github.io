### Feedback culture





NMC (GA)- 2 weeks
Justin as EM. Health info company Product roadmap for EDC in clinical trials and strategic partner proposition deck for PharmaCos
My role: 
1. expert interviews (former CFO of top cancer center)
2. slides on international considerations, network size, case studies of successful partnerships demonstrating infrastructure and ability to scale, and comparison to competitors

CCA (4 weeks in Boston)
Medical cost initiatives in the typical PrimeX fashion. Silver as EM
1. Own two initiatives: EIU and PA
2. EIU: list, precedents, coverage, spend
3. PA: opportunity for adding and removing codes, identifying providers that are not requesting PA and potentially abusing the system

Reflection:
1. Strategy and analytics
2. Start and end
3. Grown a lot—great feedback on attitude and quant ability vs. top-down communication and managing optics 
4. Had a lot of fun: Joe’s bday and scotch tasting 
5. I’d be very excited to rejoin after edu and training
