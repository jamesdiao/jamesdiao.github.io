    <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
    <p> Hi! My name is James and I'm a medical student in the <a href = "https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/health-sciences-technology/">HST Program</a> at Harvard Medical School and MIT who enjoys ballroom dancing, edge casing, and armchair philosophizing. I wanted to document my learning, projects, and interests throughout my education, and this is where I've decided to put it.</p>

  <p>I grew up in Sugar Land, Texas, a suburban outgrowth of Houston. Houston was a fantastic place to grow up: I especially loved the diversity of its communities and the quality of its food scene. I spent most of high school competing with the speech and debate team and working at the Texas Medical Center, before coming to the Northeast for college.</p>

  <p> I graduated from Yale, where I studied <a href="http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/statistics/">Statistics</a> and <a href = "http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/molecular-biophysics-biochemistry/">Biochemistry</a>. I also found time to develop my research interests with the <a href="/research/gerstein-lab">Gerstein Lab</a> at Yale and the <a href="/research/zak-lab">Kohane Lab</a> at Harvard. Outside of class and lab, I spent most of my time learning and practicing ballroom dance, which is by far my favorite hobby. I'm very grateful to have been able to keep up with it since coming to Boston. </p>

  <b>Consulting</b>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-10">
  <p> After undergrad, I interned at the consulting firm <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/overview">McKinsey & Company</a>, where I supported two client studies in the <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/how-we-help-clients">Healthcare Systems & Services</a> practice. It was a great opportunity to learn more about the business of healthcare and contribute analyses toward strategic decisions at the C-suite level. It also didn't hurt that I got to explore New York City and offset some of my tuition bill. </p>

  <p> Now at Harvard, I joined a subgroup of medical students dual-enrolled at MIT. The HST program brought me together with an amazing community of aspiring clinicians and scientists, all with the same unabashed love of science and wholehearted sense of mission. Learning and growing with them has been such an incredible adventure—they've taught me so much! </p>

  HST's research program also enabled me to continue developing my interests in unconventional ways, including through industry research. After jumping through a few logistic hoops, I had the remarkable opportunity to join <a href="http://www.pathai.com">PathAI</a> and its vision to bring computer vision to pathologist workflows. As part of the machine learning team, I worked on human-interpretable risk stratification from cancer histology slides and was able to count this work towards my HST MD thesis.

<p> All of these experiences have gotten me really excited about the possibilities for modern computational methods applied to age-old clinical problems. Specifically, I was blown away by research that described superhuman diagnostic classifiers for <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588763">diabetic retinopathy</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21056.html">skin cancers</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01836.pdf">heart arrhythmias</a>. It's an incredible feat, and I love how this kind of work has a direct and powerful link to improving care. One day, if all goes well, I would love to get involved in and contribute to similar advances. </p>
