    <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
    <p> Hi! My name is James and I'm a medical student at Harvard-MIT who enjoys ballroom dancing, edge casing, and armchair philosophizing. I wanted to document my learning, projects, and interests throughout my education, and this is where I've decided to put it.</p>

  <p>I grew up in Sugar Land, Texas, a suburban outgrowth of Houston. I spent most of high school with the speech and debate team, where I first started learning about public policy and normative ethics. I spent the rest of my time <a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/donors-volunteers/volunteer/teen-volunteer-leadership-program.html">volunteering</a> and <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/margaret-goodell">working</a> at the Texas Medical Center, before coming to the Northeast for college.</p>

  <p> I graduated from Yale, where I studied <a href="http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/statistics/">Statistics</a> and <a href = "http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/molecular-biophysics-biochemistry/">Biochemistry</a>. My coursework inspired me to explore research in biomedical informatics, which led me to <a href="/research/gerstein-lab">Gerstein Lab</a> at Yale and <a href="/research/zak-lab">Zak Lab</a> at Harvard. Outside of class and lab, I spent most of my time learning ballroom dance, my favorite hobby for more than five years. </p>

  <b>Consulting</b>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-10">
  <p> After undergrad, I interned at the consulting firm <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/about-us/overview">McKinsey & Company</a>, where I supported two client studies in the <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/how-we-help-clients">Healthcare Systems & Services</a> practice. It was a great opportunity to learn more about the business of healthcare and contribute analyses toward strategic decisions at the C-suite level. It also didn't hurt that I got to explore New York City and offset some of my tuition bill. </p>

  <p> Now at Harvard, I joined a subgroup of medical students dual-enrolled at MIT in the <a href = "https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/health-sciences-technology/">HST program</a>. I recently finished my preclinical coursework with this amazing community of aspiring clinicians and researchers, and will be starting my rotations at <a href = "https://hms.harvard.edu/affiliates/beth-israel-deaconess-medical-center">Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center</a> in April 2021.</p>

  <p>As a first-year medical student, I had the remarkable opportunity to join the tech startup <a href="http://www.pathai.com">PathAI</a> and its vision to bring computer vision to pathologist workflows. As part of the machine learning team, I worked on deep learning for tissue and cell prediction, as well as human-interpretable prediction of molecular phenotypes.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-10">
  For my research year, I joined Apple's Motion Health team, where I was the Directly Responsible Individual on several projects for the <a href="http://www.bwhresearch.org/appleheartandmovementstudy/">Apple Heart and Movement Study</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/09/singapore-and-apple-partner-on-national-health-initiative-using-apple-watch/">LumiHealth</a>, the Apple-Singapore national health initiative. My work focused on validating the effectiveness of health features across diverse populations.

<p> All of these experiences have gotten me really excited about the possibilities for modern computational methods applied to age-old clinical problems. Specifically, I was blown away by research that described superhuman diagnostic classifiers for <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588763">diabetic retinopathy</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21056.html">skin cancers</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01836.pdf">heart arrhythmias</a>. It's an incredible feat, and I love how this kind of work has a direct and powerful link to improving care. One day, if all goes well, I would love to get involved in and contribute to similar advances. </p>
