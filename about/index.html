    <h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
    <p> Hi! My name is James Diao. I studied <a href="http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/statistics/">Statistics</a> and <a href = "http://catalog.yale.edu/ycps/subjects-of-instruction/molecular-biophysics-biochemistry/">Biochemistry</a> at Yale, and am now a medical student in Harvard-MIT's <a href = "https://meded.hms.harvard.edu/health-sciences-technology/">HST Program</a>. I wanted to document my learning, projects, and interests throughout my education, and this is where I've decided to put it.</p>

  <p> I grew up in Sugar Land, Texas, a suburban outgrowth of Houston. I lived there for eighteen years before coming to the Northeast for college. At Yale, I took up <a href="http://www.yaleballroom.org/resources/pages/team.html">Ballroom and Latin dance</a>, which is how I spent a lot of my free time. Happily, I've still found time to keep practicing and competing as part of the MIT team. I also found time to explore my interest in medicine: the scientific side through my <a href="/class/yale-courses">classes</a> and research, and the clinical side at Yale-New Haven Hospital and <a href="https://www.havenfreeclinic.com/">HAVEN Free Clinic</a>. </p>
  <p> My undergraduate research work covered two distinct fields: molecular bioinformatics in the <a href="/research/gerstein-lab">Gerstein Lab</a> at Yale and clinical genetics in the <a href="/research/zak-lab">Kohane Lab</a> at Harvard Medical School. In the Gerstein Lab, I worked on developing a public plotting tool for exRNA-Seq and inferring biofluids and tissues of origin. In the Kohane Lab (Zak Lab), I used large and diverse sequencing cohorts to estimate the predictive capacity of certain genetic tests and identify differences between ethnic populations. </p>
  <p> Right now, I'm especially excited about applications of deep learning to biomedical problems. Specifically, I was blown away by three papers that described superhuman classification of disease states (e.g. <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2588763">diabetic retinopathy</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v542/n7639/full/nature21056.html">skin cancers</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01836.pdf">heart arrhythmias</a>). It's an incredible feat, and I love how this kind of work has a direct and powerful link to improving care. One day, if all goes well, I would love to get involved and contribute to similar advances.</p>
